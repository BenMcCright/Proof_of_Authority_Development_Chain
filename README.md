# ðŸ§±ðŸ”— Proof_of_Authority_Development_Chain ðŸ§±ðŸ”—
Setting up a custom testnet blockchain, send a transaction, create a repository, and document the steps of how this process is done.

This tutorial will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to create your own private Proof of Authority Blockchain.
## What you need to get started
* [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth)
This is the toolset used to create your nodes and blockchain
* [MyCrypto](https://download.mycrypto.com/)
This is the application we will use to maintain your Ethereum accounts and conduct a trade from one account to another

## Create Nodes
Unzip the Geth CLI toolset and open a git bash terminal from the unzipped folder

In git bash, run the following code to create your first node(node1). You will need to create a password, and SAVE THAT PASSWORD!
geth --datadir node1 account new
Your node will have a public address key and a secret key file automatically generated. SAVE THESE!

Repeate this same process for your second node(node2). Save the password that you generate, as well as the public address and secret file.
geth --datadir node2 account new

You will notice that new folders have been populated into your unzipped folder labeled as what you named your nodes(node1 & node2).
